# ToolDispatch — Claude Code Configuration

## Mission

Dispatch provides **VISIBLE guidance, diagnostics, and corrective action** to the developer — in conversation, where they can see and act on it. Every module (Dispatch, XFBA, XSIA, XFTC) must surface findings to Russ directly. If Russ can't see it, it didn't happen.

---

## XFBA + XSIA Protocol (SUPREME)

Claude is the analyst. Russ is the decision-maker. Both tools surface findings — Russ decides what to do.

**When XFBA blocks an edit** (code contract violation — type, import, arity):
1. Surface the violation in plain English
2. Explain whether it looks like a real bug or a false positive
3. Ask: "Fix it, suppress it, or proceed anyway?" — wait for answer

**When XSIA fires** (systemic impact concern):
1. Surface the flagged concerns in plain English
2. Explain whether each looks routine or substantive
3. Ask: "Fix impact issues or let it ride?" — wait for answer

**Never auto-bypass either tool.** Exception: if Russ already said "let it ride" / "proceed" in the current message.

---

## XFTC Notice Protocol (SUPREME)

Hook stdout is NOT visible to Russ — it only reaches Claude's context. XFTC writes user-intended notices to `~/.claude/dispatch/xftc_pending.json`.

**At the start of EVERY response in a Dispatch session:**
1. Read `~/.claude/dispatch/xftc_pending.json`
2. If it has content, surface ALL lines at the top of your response as a quoted block
3. Write `[]` back to the file to clear it

This is the ONLY way Russ sees XFTC notifications. Do not skip this step.

**Stack:** Python 3.8+ · Bash · Claude Haiku (free) / Sonnet 4.6 (Pro)
**Repo:** github.com/ToolDispatch/Dispatch
**Server:** `/home/visionairy/Dispatch-API/app.py` — auto-deploys to Render on `git push`

## Hooks

| Hook | Trigger | Does |
|------|---------|------|
| `dispatch.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Haiku shift detection → writes state.json |
| `dispatch-preuse.sh` | PreToolUse (Skill/Agent/mcp__*) | Scores + blocks on 10pt gap |
| `dispatch-stop.sh` | Stop | One-line session digest |
| `xftc-submit.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Token hog nudges (MCP overhead, CLAUDE.md size, context) |
| `xftc-preuse.sh` | PreToolUse (Agent/Bash) | Sub-agent model + verbose command checks |

**Installed:** `~/.claude/hooks/` (hook scripts) · `~/.claude/dispatch/` (Python modules + state)
**State:** `~/.claude/dispatch/state.json`

## Key Modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `classifier.py` | Haiku shift detection, emits task_type + preferred_tool_type |
| `evaluator.py` | `search_by_category()`, `rank_recommendations()`, `build_recommendation_list()` |
| `interceptor.py` | PreToolUse parsing, bypass token, state readers |
| `category_mapper.py` | Maps task_type → MECE category_id; logs unknowns |
| `categories.json` | 16-category catalog with `search_terms` + `mcp_search_terms` |
| `stack_scanner.py` | Detects languages/frameworks/MCPs from project files + .mcp.json |
| `llm_client.py` | OpenRouter-first, Anthropic fallback, noop |

---

## Install / Sync

```bash
cp classifier.py evaluator.py interceptor.py category_mapper.py categories.json \
   llm_client.py stack_scanner.py ~/.claude/dispatch/
cp dispatch.sh ~/.claude/hooks/dispatch.sh
cp preuse_hook.sh ~/.claude/hooks/dispatch-preuse.sh
cp stop_hook.sh ~/.claude/hooks/dispatch-stop.sh
```

---

## Testing

```bash
cd /home/visionairy/Dispatch
python3 -m pytest test_classifier.py test_evaluator.py test_interceptor.py \
  test_category_mapper.py test_llm_client.py test_stack_scanner.py -v
```

263 client tests must pass before pushing. Live test requires a new CC session.

---

## CC Transcript Format (Critical)

Entries: `{"type":"user", "isMeta":bool, "message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}, ...}`

- `role` is nested inside `message` — `entry.get("role")` always returns `None`
- `isMeta=True` = CC system messages — exclude
- Content starting with `[{` = serialized tool result — exclude

`extract_recent_messages` handles all three. Do not revert these filters.

---

## Documentation Update Protocol

After any change affecting user-facing behavior, install steps, API contracts, or pricing:

| Change type | Update |
|-------------|--------|
| New feature / behavior | README, user-guide.md, SKILL.md |
| Install change | README, user-guide.md getting started |
| Pricing change | README table, user-guide.md, app.py upsell |
| Hook behavior change | README, user-guide.md, CLAUDE.md |
| New server env var | admin-guide.md |
| Roadmap item done | README checkboxes, CLAUDE.md roadmap |

- [x] Category-first MECE model (16 categories)
- [x] Three-component scoring (Relevance · Signal · Velocity)
- [x] MCP + Plugin support (glama, Anthropic official, community)
- [x] Hosted endpoint — dispatch.visionairy.biz, $10/month Pro
- [x] Daily catalog cron (16,500+ tools)
- [x] Admin + User dashboards, Stripe, Slack notifications
- [x] XFTC — Module 3 (session-based token hog nudges)
- [ ] Weekly category scoring cron (zero live API at hook time)
- [ ] skills.sh distribution (`npx skills add VisionAIrySE/Dispatch`)
- [ ] CC marketplace submission
- [ ] End-to-end live session test + recording

## Architectural Principles

**XSIA builds on XFBA. Always. No exceptions.**

XFBA is Stage 1 — catches contract violations (wrong type, broken import, bad arity). XSIA is Stage 5 — analyzes systemic impact (what else breaks when this change lands). If XFBA finds a violation, XSIA still runs but is marked "fix XFBA first." You cannot meaningfully analyze cascade impact on broken code. XFBA is the gate, XSIA is the consequence map.

Applies to new checkers too: any JSON/YAML/config schema checker belongs in XFBA. Any cascade or field-kill-field analysis belongs in XSIA. Build XFBA first, XSIA second.

---

## Architectural Principle Protocol

When a definition, dependency rule, or design invariant is discovered that would prevent a recurring class of mistake or guide future development — commit it to this file immediately, not just to memory.

**Triggers:** a question gets answered that shouldn't need answering again ("which builds on the other?"), a bug is traced to a missing rule ("XFBA doesn't cover JSON"), or a pattern is validated in production.

**Format:** one heading, one clear statement of the rule, one sentence on why, one sentence on how to apply it. No multi-paragraph essays — if it needs more, it goes in `~/.claude/ref/`.
