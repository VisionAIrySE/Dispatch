# Dispatch

**The missing layer for Claude Code — automatically surfaces the right plugins and skills before every task.**

Claude Code has 500+ plugins and skills across multiple marketplaces. You're probably using 5 of them. Dispatch watches your conversation, detects when you shift to a new task, and recommends exactly what you need — before Claude responds.

The hosted version gets smarter every day. As developers use Dispatch across thousands of sessions, aggregate patterns sharpen what gets recommended for each stack. New tools published to the skills registry are discovered automatically — no updates, no configuration, no manual curation. The longer Dispatch runs, the better it gets at knowing what you need before you do.

```

## The problem

You're mid-session debugging a Flutter widget, then you say "actually let's write some tests." Claude proceeds — but your flutter-mobile-app-dev skill isn't loaded, and the test-driven-development skill you installed last month never comes up.

The Claude Code plugin ecosystem is powerful but invisible at runtime. You have to know what you have and manually invoke it. Most sessions, you forget.

Dispatch fixes this automatically.

---

## What it does

Every message you send, Dispatch:

1. **Detects topic shifts** — Uses Claude Haiku to classify whether you've started a new type of task
2. **Evaluates your plugins** — Scans every installed Claude Code plugin and agent skill
3. **Searches the registry** — Queries [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) for relevant uninstalled options
4. **Shows recommendations** — Pauses 3 seconds so you can see what's available, then proceeds automatically

It's invisible when you don't need it. It surfaces when you do.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VisionAIrySE/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` will prompt you to connect via GitHub — sign in, copy the token, paste it back. That's it. No API key needed.

Start a **new** Claude Code session. Dispatch is active immediately.

> Dispatch hooks into `UserPromptSubmit` which loads at session startup — existing sessions won't pick it up.

### BYOK mode (bring your own API key)

If you prefer to run entirely self-hosted with your own Anthropic key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Persist across sessions:
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' >> ~/.bashrc   # bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' >> ~/.zshrc    # zsh
```

Dispatch will use your key directly — no token, no server, no data leaving your machine.

---

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** v1.x+ (hooks support required)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js + npx** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Either:** a free Dispatch account (recommended) **or** an Anthropic API key

The `anthropic` Python package installs automatically via `install.sh`.

---

## Cost

**Hosted (recommended):** Free for 5 detections/day. Upgrade for unlimited at **$6/month** → [dispatch.visionairy.biz/pro](https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/pro)

The hosted version is more than convenience — it's collective intelligence. Every session across every user improves what gets recommended for your stack. BYOK runs the same algorithm in isolation; hosted runs it with the benefit of aggregate signal from the whole community.

New tools added to the skills registry are picked up automatically. You don't update Dispatch — Dispatch updates itself.

**BYOK (self-hosted):** Runs the raw algorithm with your own Anthropic key. No data sharing, no improving recommendations, no network effect. Good for privacy-first setups.

| Stage | Trigger | Cost |
|-------|---------|------|
| Shift detection | Every message | ~$0.0001 |
| Plugin ranking | On topic shift only | ~$0.001 |

**Typical session (10 messages, 2-3 topic shifts): less than $0.005.**

## Getting the most out of Dispatch

Dispatch recommends from whatever you have installed. The more plugins you have, the better it gets.

**Add the official marketplaces in Claude Code:**

```
/plugins add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
/plugins add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
```

**Add official stack-specific skills:**

```bash
# Firebase
npx skills add firebase/agent-skills@firebase-firestore-basics -y
npx skills add firebase/agent-skills@firebase-auth-basics -y
npx skills add firebase/agent-skills@firebase-basics -y

# Supabase
npx skills add supabase/agent-skills@supabase-postgres-best-practices -y -g
```

**Browse the full registry:**
- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) — 500+ skills (`npx skills find <query>`)
- [VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills) — curated list

---

## How it works

**Stage 1 — Classification (every message, ~100ms)**

Haiku receives your last 3 messages and current working directory. Returns `{"shift": bool, "task_type": str, "confidence": float}`. If no shift or confidence below 0.7, exits silently — you never see it.

**Smart skipping** — messages under 6 words and follow-up questions skip classification entirely.

**Stage 2 — Evaluation (on confirmed shift only)**

Scans `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` for installed plugins, runs `npx skills list` for agent skills, searches the registry for uninstalled matches. Haiku ranks everything by relevance and presents the top results.

---

## Supported task types

Any. Dispatch doesn't use a fixed list — it generates the most specific label it can from your conversation and uses that to search the live skills registry. If a skill exists for what you're doing, Dispatch will find it.

Examples of what it detects: `flutter` · `react` · `nextjs` · `python` · `docker` · `aws` · `langchain` · `supabase` · `firebase` · `prisma` · `graphql` · `postgres` · `redis` · `stripe` · `github-actions` · `n8n` · `debugging` · `testing` · `devops` · `security` · and anything else in the registry.

As new skills get published to [skills.sh](https://skills.sh), Dispatch picks them up automatically — no updates required.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Dispatch isn't firing**
- Start a **new** Claude Code session after install
- Verify your key: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Check it's registered: look for `UserPromptSubmit` in `~/.claude/settings.json`

**UI shows but no recommendations**
- Install more plugins — see [Getting the most out of Dispatch](#getting-the-most-out-of-dispatch)
- The detected task type may not match any installed plugins yet

**Hook takes a long time**
- 10 second hard timeout — Claude proceeds normally if exceeded
- Check your internet connection (registry search requires network)

---

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/skill-router
rm ~/.claude/hooks/skill-router.sh
```

Then remove the `UserPromptSubmit` entry from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

## Contributing

This is an early release. The most valuable thing you can do is use it and report back.

Open an Issue with:
- What task type triggered Dispatch
- Whether the recommendations were relevant
- Any errors you saw

Pull requests welcome. The classifier taxonomy and evaluator ranking logic are the best places to start.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Caching layer for plugin registry (reduce npx latency)
- [ ] `/dispatch status` command to inspect current state
- [ ] Expand task type taxonomy (React, Python, Docker, AWS...)
- [ ] skills.sh distribution
- [x] Hosted endpoint — no API key required (live at dispatch.visionairy.biz)

---

## Why this exists

Other tools in this space — like SummonAI — charge $100 to write custom skills tailored to your current stack. That's a great product if you know exactly what you need and want it built for you.

Dispatch is a different bet entirely.

Instead of building tools for a fixed stack, Dispatch finds the best tools for whatever you're doing right now — across any stack, any task, mid-session. Already have Flutter skills installed? It surfaces them when you switch to a Flutter task. Want to know if there's a better Supabase skill than the one you're using? It checks the registry before you even think to ask.

It doesn't care what your stack is. It cares what you're doing in the next five minutes.

The Claude Code plugin ecosystem is genuinely underutilized. Most developers install a handful of plugins and forget the rest exist. Dispatch is the runtime layer that was missing — a router that knows your context and connects you to the right tools automatically.

The code is open source. Run it yourself if you want — it works. But the hosted version knows something your local copy doesn't: what tools thousands of other developers reach for when they're doing exactly what you're doing right now. That gap widens every day.

Built because I needed it. Shared because you probably do too.

This is a vibe coding project — I built Dispatch for myself over a weekend using Claude Code, then cleaned it up enough to share.

## Privacy

**Self-hosted (BYOK):** Haiku API calls go directly from your machine to Anthropic. No data passes through our servers, ever.

**Hosted:** Classification requests pass through dispatch.visionairy.biz. We store only your GitHub username, email, and usage count. We will never sell individual session data. Aggregate patterns — what stacks developers work on, which plugins get recommended — may be used to improve recommendations for everyone, and only in anonymized form.

You'll always have the self-hosted option with zero data leaving your machine.

---

## Support

Free plan gives you 5 detections/day — enough to evaluate whether Dispatch fits your workflow.

If it does, [upgrade to Pro for $6/month](https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/pro). Unlimited detections, and you're contributing to the data pool that makes recommendations sharper for everyone. The more Pro users, the better the signal.

You can also fork it, run it with your own API key, and never pay a cent. The code is open — the value is in the service. If you'd rather just say thanks, [buy me a coffee](https://github.com/sponsors/VisionAIrySE).

Star it if it helps. Share it if someone else would use it.
