**Your Claude Code insurance policy — best tool for the job up front, code that connects before it breaks.**

ToolDispatch puts the best tool in Claude's hands at the right moment. XF Audit ensures the code it produces actually connects. One platform. Both sides of the problem. And it leaves a record of everything it did.

**Dispatch** covers the first half: 10,000+ tools exist for Claude Code across plugins, skills, and MCP servers. New ones ship every week. Claude picks from defaults. The best tool for what you're actually building right now — you've probably never heard of it. Dispatch fixes this by proactively surfacing the right tools when your task shifts, and intercepting when Claude reaches for a weaker one. All decisions are logged with `[PROVENANCE]` markers for transparency.

**XF Audit** covers the second half: Claude Code produces architecturally sound code that often doesn't connect. It renames a function and misses three callers. It calls a function with the wrong number of arguments. These failures are silent until runtime — and by then the session context is gone. XF Audit closes that loop at the edit boundary, where the cost of fixing is near-zero and the context is still live.

> One platform. Both sides of the problem. And it leaves a receipt.

## The two modules

### Dispatch — tool routing

Dispatch runs as three Claude Code hooks wired together:

**Hook 3 — fires when the session ends.** Prints a one-line digest so you can see Dispatch was running the whole time — even when it correctly stayed silent. Example:

```
[Dispatch] Session: 12 tool calls audited · 0 blocked (all optimal) · 1 recommendation shown
```

**Hook 1 — fires on every message you send.** Sends your last few messages to a small model for ~100ms. If it detects a task shift (you moved from debugging a Flutter widget to writing tests, say), it maps the shift to a category and immediately surfaces grouped tool recommendations into Claude's context (Stage 3). Recommendations are grouped by type: Plugins, Skills, and MCPs. You see them once per topic per session.

Example proactive output (on task shift):

```
[Dispatch] Recommended tools for this flutter-building task:

Plugins:
  • flutter-mobile-app-dev — Expert Flutter agent for widgets, state, iOS/Android.
    Install: claude install plugin:anthropic:flutter-mobile-app-dev

Skills:
  • VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev — Flutter dev skill for widget building.
    Install: claude install VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev

MCPs:
  • fluttermcp — Dart analysis and widget tree inspection server.
    Install: claude mcp add fluttermcp npx -y @fluttermcp/server

Not sure which to pick? Ask me — I can explain the differences.
```

If no task shift is detected, Hook 1 exits silently with no output.

**Hook 2 — fires before every tool call.** When Claude is about to invoke a Skill, Agent, or MCP tool, Dispatch intercepts it. It searches the marketplace — npm skills, the Claude plugin registries, and glama.ai for MCPs — for tools relevant to your current task, scores them against what Claude was about to use, and if a marketplace tool scores 10+ points higher — it blocks the call and surfaces the comparison:

```
[DISPATCH] Intercepted: CC is about to use 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' for Flutter Fixing.
CC's tool score for this task: 62/100

Marketplace alternatives:
  1. flutter-mobile-app-dev [94/100] ← TOP PICK
     Why: Purpose-built for Flutter/Dart debugging with widget tree inspection.
     Install + restart: npx skills add flutter-mobile-app-dev -y && claude

⚠ A marketplace tool scores higher than 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' for this task.
  Options:
  1. Say 'proceed' to continue with 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' (one-time bypass)
  2. Install flutter-mobile-app-dev — run /compact first, then install and restart CC
  3. Ignore Dispatch for this task — say 'skip dispatch'

Present these options to the user. Wait for their response before taking any action.
```

If no marketplace tool beats Claude's choice by 10+ points, Dispatch exits silently and the tool call goes through unchanged.

---

### XF Audit — contract checking

XF Audit fires on every Edit and Write. Most of the time, Stage 1 completes in ~200ms and you see a green stamp:

```
◈ XF Audit  47 modules · 203 edges checked  ✓ 0 boundary violations
```

When something is actually wrong:

```
◈ XF Audit  This edit will break at runtime.

  evaluator.py:203 — calls rank_tools() with 3 arguments, but it only accepts 2.
  This will throw a TypeError when that code runs.

  Fix: remove the third argument, or update rank_tools() to accept it.
  [apply fix] [show me the diff first] [skip]
```

The four stages:

- **Stage 1** (~200ms, always): AST scan — syntax, missing imports, arity mismatches, hard env var access, consumed stubs. Blocks immediately on violations.
- **Stage 2** (on escalation): Xpansion cascade analysis — maps the full caller chain using MECE boundary framework (DATA, NODES, FLOW, ERRORS). Shows consequence-first output.
- **Stage 3**: Concrete repair plan — each violation gets one specific file-and-line fix.
- **Stage 4**: Graduated consent — "show me the diff first" until two verified repairs this session, then "apply all" unlocks. Resets each session.

**Refactor Mode:** `/xfa-refactor start "description"` — XF Audit shifts from blocking to tracking, holds violations until you declare done, presents consolidated repair list at once.

Every scan leaves a record in `.xf/boundary_violations.json`. Every repair is logged to `.xf/repair_log.json` with timestamp and session ID. When something goes wrong in production: the log answers whether XF Audit caught it.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToolDispatch/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` walks you through three things: checking dependencies, registering both hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, and connecting to the hosted endpoint (or using your own API key). Takes about two minutes.

Start a **new** Claude Code session after install — hooks load at session startup.

---

## Plans

### BYOK / Open Source — for developers who need full local control

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToolDispatch/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch && ./install.sh
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

- **Dispatch:** fully functional, unlimited, self-managed API key
- **XF Audit:** Stage 1 bundled (pure AST, zero API cost) — catches broken imports, arity mismatches, syntax errors on every Edit/Write
- **Stages 2–4:** upgrade prompt fires in session digest when Stage 2 would have been useful — one line, never mid-conversation, never blocking: `◈ XF Audit would have mapped that cascade. tooltooldispatch.visionairy.biz/pro`

No account needed. Everything runs locally. You lose the catalog network intelligence, Sonnet ranking, and the dashboard.

---

### Free — start here

[Sign up with GitHub](https://tooltooldispatch.visionairy.biz/auth/github) — no API key, no card required. `install.sh` will ask for your token. Takes 30 seconds.

- **Dispatch:** 8 interceptions/day + full proactive recommendations on every task shift
- **XF Audit:** Stage 1 always-on (bundled), Stages 2–4 tier-blocked with in-context upgrade prompt when Stage 2 events occurred

**What leaves your machine:** your last ~3 messages and working directory path, sent to classify the task. Not stored — we keep your GitHub username, usage count, and task type labels (e.g., `flutter-fixing`). No conversation content.

---

### Pro — $10/month

> **Founding offer:** First 300 subscribers lock in **$6/month for life**. After 300, standard rate applies.

[Upgrade at tooltooldispatch.visionairy.biz/pro](https://tooltooldispatch.visionairy.biz/pro)

- **Dispatch:** unlimited interceptions, Sonnet ranking, pre-ranked catalog
- **XF Audit:** full Stages 1–4 (Xpansion cascade analysis, concrete repair plan, graduated consent flow, repair log)
- **Dashboard:** interception history, contract repair history, provenance log

The catalog is the compounding advantage. The hosted version sees what thousands of developers actually installed after a Dispatch suggestion, which tools they bypassed, and which ones stuck. That signal builds over time and no local setup can replicate it.

| | BYOK | Free | Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dispatch — proactive recs** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Dispatch — interceptions** | Unlimited | 8/day | Unlimited |
| **Dispatch — ranking quality** | Configurable | Good | Best (Sonnet) |
| **Dispatch — catalog** | Live search | Live search | Pre-ranked, 6 sources |
| **XF Audit — Stage 1** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **XF Audit — Stages 2–4** | Upgrade prompt | Upgrade prompt | ✓ Full |
| **Dashboard** | — | — | ✓ |
| **Network intelligence** | — | — | ✓ |
| **Cost** | API costs | Free | $10/month |
| **Data sharing** | None | Task labels only | Task labels only |

## Requirements

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** (hooks support required — v1.x+)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Node.js + npx** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- One of: a Dispatch account (free) or an Anthropic API key

The `anthropic` Python package installs automatically via `install.sh`.

---

## Using it

Most of the time, Dispatch is invisible. Hook 1 runs on every message and exits silently unless it detects a shift. Hook 2 runs on every tool call but exits silently unless it finds something meaningfully better.

**When Hook 1 fires (on task shift):** You'll see a proactive list of recommended tools grouped by Plugins, Skills, and MCPs directly in Claude's context. Ask Claude to explain the differences between any of them, paste the install command for one you want, or ignore the list and keep working. Dispatch won't show the same category's suggestions again this session.

**When Hook 2 fires:** Claude pauses and shows you the comparison. You have three options:

- **Say `proceed`** — Claude uses its original tool choice, one-time bypass, no restart needed
- **Install the top pick** — run `/compact` to save session context, paste the install command, restart CC and continue where you left off
- **Say `skip dispatch`** — Dispatch ignores this task type going forward in the session

The threshold is a 10-point gap. If the best marketplace alternative scores 72 and Claude's tool scores 64, Dispatch blocks. If the gap is 9 points or less, it passes through silently.

---

## How the scoring works

When Hook 2 intercepts a tool call, it:

1. Reads the current task category from state (written by Hook 1 on the last detected shift)
2. Searches the marketplace for tools matching that category's keywords
3. Scores each result 0–100 for relevance to the specific task — considering tool name, description, and the task context
4. Scores Claude's chosen tool on the same scale
5. Blocks if the top result beats Claude's score by 10+, passes through otherwise

**Free/BYOK** — hits the live [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) marketplace and glama.ai MCP registry on each intercept (~2–4s)

**Pro** — pulls from a pre-ranked catalog built by a daily crawl across npm, skills.sh, glama.ai, and the Claude plugin registries. Tools are classified into a hierarchical taxonomy (category → subcategory → leaf node) during the crawl. At intercept time, Dispatch maps your task to the closest taxonomy leaf and returns a pure catalog query — no LLM call. Intercept response is <200ms.

---

## Get more out of it

Dispatch recommends from the full marketplace — installed or not. But its scores improve with better tool descriptions. Add the official marketplaces to give it more signal:

```
/plugins add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
/plugins add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
```

Browse for skills relevant to your stack:

```bash
npx skills find flutter
npx skills find supabase
npx skills find react
```

The more skills in the registry that match your work, the more often Dispatch has something useful to surface.

---

## How the categories work

Dispatch uses a hierarchical MECE taxonomy with 16 top-level categories: `source-control`, `data-storage`, `search-discovery`, `ai-ml`, `frontend`, `mobile`, `backend`, `infrastructure`, `delivery`, `integrations`, `identity-security`, `observability`, `testing`, `data-engineering`, `payments`, `documentation`. Each category breaks down into subcategories and leaf nodes (e.g. `data-storage → relational → postgresql`).

When Haiku detects a task shift, it generates a specific label like `flutter-fixing` or `postgres-rls-query`. Dispatch maps that label to the closest taxonomy leaf — scoring token overlap against 100+ leaf nodes and their tags. The leaf drives marketplace search with precise vocabulary (e.g. `postgresql` maps to postgres/rls/migration/query terms), which is more targeted than keyword-splitting the task label directly.

Pro users get the full taxonomy path sent to the catalog — results filtered by leaf node and matching tags, sorted by pre-computed signal scores with no LLM involved.

Unknown task types are logged to `unknown_categories.jsonl` in the dispatch directory — if you're working in a niche stack and Dispatch consistently misses, that file tells you why.

---

## Stack detection

On install, and again whenever you change working directories, Dispatch scans your project's manifest files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pubspec.yaml`, etc.) to build a stack profile. Pro users' catalog results are reranked using this profile — a Flutter project gets `flutter-mobile-app-dev` ranked higher than a generic mobile tool even if their base scores are similar.

The stack profile lives at `~/.claude/dispatch/stack_profile.json` and updates automatically.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Dispatch isn't intercepting anything**
- Start a **new** Claude Code session after install — hooks load at startup
- Check both hooks are registered: look for `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` entries in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Verify your key or token: `cat ~/.claude/dispatch/config.json`

**Dispatch fires but passes everything through**
- This is correct behavior most of the time — it only blocks when the gap is 10+ points
- If marketplace search returns nothing, there's nothing to compare against

**Proactive recommendations aren't appearing**
- Start a **new** Claude Code session after install — hooks load at startup
- Check that Hook 1 is registered: look for `UserPromptSubmit` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Proactive recommendations fire only on a confirmed task shift with confidence ≥ 0.7 — if you're continuing the same topic, no output is expected

**Hook is slow**
- 10s hard timeout — Claude proceeds normally if exceeded
- Pro catalog responses are <200ms; BYOK/Free search takes 2–4s

**"Degraded mode" warning during install**
- The `anthropic` package installed but Python can't import it (common on system Python with PEP 668 restrictions)
- Fix: `pip3 install anthropic --break-system-packages` or use a virtualenv

---

## Uninstall

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

Removes all installed files, hook scripts, and settings.json entries automatically. Also cleans up pre-v0.9.2 installs if present.

---

## Security

- **No `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` modification** — Dispatch doesn't touch your global Claude instructions
- **No credential harvesting** — reads only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from your environment
- **No shell injection** — task type labels always passed as `sys.argv`, never interpolated into shell strings
- **Open source** — every line of both hooks and all Python modules is in this repo; verify before installing
- **10-second hard timeout** — enforced by Claude Code; Dispatch cannot hang your session

---

## Privacy

**BYOK:** Haiku calls go directly from your machine to Anthropic. Nothing passes through our servers.

**Hosted (Free and Pro):** The following data is sent to and stored at tooldispatch.visionairy.biz:

| Data | Stored? | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Last ~3 messages | **No** | Sent for classification, discarded immediately |
| Working directory path | **No** | Sent for context, not stored |
| GitHub username + email | **Yes** | Collected via GitHub OAuth at signup |
| Task type label (e.g. `flutter-fixing`) | **Yes** | Stored per interception event |
| Tool intercepted + relevance scores | **Yes** | Tool name, CC score, marketplace score |
| Blocked / bypassed / installed | **Yes** | Powers your Pro dashboard |
| Stack profile (languages/frameworks) | **Local only** | Stored in `~/.claude/dispatch/stack_profile.json` |

We don't store conversation content. We don't sell individual user data. Aggregate, anonymized patterns (e.g. what percentage of mobile developers install Flutter skills after a Dispatch suggestion) improve catalog rankings network-wide.

**Creator outreach:** When the daily catalog crawl finds a skill with install activity but no description, Dispatch may open a GitHub issue on that repo asking the creator to add a description. At most once per repo per 30 days. Issues include a note that the creator can close with no action required.

To delete your account and all stored data, email hello@tooldispatch.visionairy.biz. To stop all data sharing immediately, switch to BYOK mode.

## Why this exists

Two problems define every Claude Code session. The first: the tool ecosystem is enormous and growing, but Claude picks from defaults. You're always flying blind on tool selection. The second: Claude Code produces architecturally sound code that often doesn't connect — renames a function and misses three callers, calls with the wrong arguments, imports a symbol that was refactored away. These failures are silent until runtime.

ToolDispatch covers both sides. Dispatch is the runtime layer that ensures Claude reaches for the best tool. XF Audit is the safety net that ensures the code those tools produce actually connects. One install. Both problems. And it leaves a record of everything it did — so when something goes wrong in production, you can answer: did we catch this?

The hosted version knows something a local install can never know: what tools thousands of other developers actually reached for when they were doing exactly what you're doing right now — and which ones they kept. That signal compounds over time. [Start free.](https://tooldispatch.visionairy.biz/auth/github)
