# ToolDispatch User Guide

**ToolDispatch** — your Claude Code insurance policy. Two modules that cover both sides of the problem.

**Dispatch** surfaces the best plugin, skill, or MCP when you shift tasks, and blocks tool calls when a better marketplace alternative exists. **XF Audit** catches broken module contracts before they run — syntax errors, missing imports, arity mismatches, broken function signatures — and provides a concrete repair plan with graduated consent.

You don't know what you don't know. Neither does Claude Code. And the ecosystem is exploding — new tools ship every week, the gap between what you're using and what's out there grows every day. And Claude Code produces architecturally sound code that often doesn't connect. ToolDispatch covers both problems, leaves a record, and gets out of the way.

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToolDispatch/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch
bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` takes ~2 minutes. It:
- Checks Python 3.8+ and Node.js are available
- Registers two hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Asks how you want to connect — Hosted (recommended, free token) or BYOK (bring your own Anthropic key, for restricted environments)

### 2. Get a free token (Hosted mode)

When `install.sh` asks for a token, visit:

```
https://tooldispatch.visionairy.biz/auth/github
```

Sign in with GitHub. Copy the token shown on screen and paste it into the install prompt.

**Already installed and need your token?** Visit `https://tooldispatch.visionairy.biz/token-lookup` — it re-runs OAuth and shows your token again.

### 3. Start a new CC session

**Critical:** hooks load at session startup. The install won't affect your current session. Open a new terminal and run `claude` (or restart your IDE's CC session).

### 4. Verify it's running

In the new session, type:

```
/dispatch status
```

You'll see your mode, plan, token (masked), and whether both hooks are installed. If a hook shows MISSING, re-run `bash install.sh`.

## What happens during a session

Here's what's actually running:

**Every message you send** — Hook 1 runs (~100ms). It reads your last few messages and checks if you've shifted to a different type of task. If you haven't shifted, it exits silently. If you have, it maps the shift to a category and immediately surfaces grouped tool recommendations (Stage 3) into Claude's context — grouped by Plugins, Skills, and MCPs. You see each category's recommendations once per session.

**Every tool call Claude makes** — Hook 2 runs before Claude uses a Skill, Agent, or MCP tool. It checks the marketplace for tools relevant to your current task. If it finds one that scores 10+ points higher than what Claude was about to use, it blocks and shows you the comparison.

---

## When Dispatch recommends proactively

When Dispatch detects a task shift, it immediately surfaces a grouped recommendation list into Claude's context — before Claude reaches for any tool. You'll see something like this:

```
[Dispatch] Recommended tools for this flutter-building task:

Plugins:
  • flutter-mobile-app-dev — Expert Flutter agent for widgets, state, iOS/Android.
    Install: claude install plugin:anthropic:flutter-mobile-app-dev

Skills:
  • VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev — Flutter dev skill for widget building.
    Install: claude install VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev

MCPs:
  • fluttermcp — Dart analysis and widget tree inspection server.
    Install: claude mcp add fluttermcp npx -y @fluttermcp/server

Not sure which to pick? Ask me — I can explain the differences.
```

### What to do with it

**Ask Claude about any of them** — say "what's the difference between the plugin and the MCP?" Claude will explain based on what Dispatch surfaced.

**Install one** — paste the install command shown, or run it manually. For tools that require a restart, use `/compact` first to preserve your session context.

**Ignore it and keep working** — the list appears once and won't repeat for the same topic this session. There's no prompt waiting for a response.

## When Dispatch intercepts

Hook 2 fires before every Skill, Agent, or MCP tool call. When Claude's chosen tool scores 10+ points lower than a marketplace alternative, Dispatch blocks and shows you the comparison:

```
[DISPATCH] Intercepted: CC is about to use 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' for Flutter Fixing.
CC's tool score for this task: 62/100

Marketplace alternatives:
  1. flutter-mobile-app-dev [94/100] ← TOP PICK
     Why: Purpose-built for Flutter/Dart debugging with widget tree inspection.
     Install: npx skills add flutter-mobile-app-dev -y && claude

⚠ A marketplace tool scores higher than 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' for this task.
  Options:
  1. Say 'proceed' to continue with the current tool
  2. Install flutter-mobile-app-dev (run /compact first, then install and restart CC)
  3. Say 'skip dispatch' to ignore this task type for the rest of the session
```

### Your three options

**1. Say `proceed`**
Claude uses its original tool choice. The bypass lasts for this one tool call. If Claude reaches for the same tool again, Dispatch will check again (unless you say `skip dispatch`).

**2. Install the recommended tool**
```bash
/compact          # saves your session context
npx skills add flutter-mobile-app-dev -y
claude            # restart — picks up where you left off
```
The tool is now available to Claude for future sessions.

**3. Say `skip dispatch`**
Dispatch ignores this task type for the rest of the current session. Use this when you've already got the right tools for the job and don't need suggestions.

## Check your status

```
/dispatch status
```

Shows:
- **Mode** — hosted, byok, or unconfigured
- **Plan** — free or pro
- **Token** — masked display
- **Hook 1 / Hook 2** — installed or MISSING
- **Last task** — most recent task type Dispatch classified
- **Category** — which of the 16 MECE categories it mapped to
- **Working dir** — where the last shift was detected
- **Bypass** — whether a bypass token is currently active

**Founding Dispatcher:** First 300 paying users lock in $6/month for life. Once the founding tier fills, new signups pay standard $10/month.

*BYOK is for developers in air-gapped or restricted environments who cannot send any data to external services. BYOK ranking quality depends on your model — set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for free inference or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Haiku. Override with any model in `~/.claude/dispatch/config.json`. If that's not you, [start with Free](https://tooldispatch.visionairy.biz/auth/github) — it's easier, smarter, and actually free.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing is happening / Dispatch is silent**

This is usually correct — Dispatch only intercepts when the gap is 10+ points. To check it's actually running:
1. Type `/dispatch status` — verify both hooks show "installed"
2. Make sure you're in a **new** CC session started after install
3. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` — look for `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook entries

**Proactive recommendations aren't appearing**

Proactive recommendations fire only on a confirmed task shift (confidence ≥ 0.7) and only once per category per session. If you haven't switched topics, no output is expected. Make sure you started a **new** CC session after install.

**"UserPromptSubmit hook error" in the sidebar**

Harmless cosmetic message. Dispatch exits cleanly on any error — it never blocks Claude. This can appear when running CC in a directory that isn't a development project (e.g. the Dispatch directory itself). Doesn't affect functionality.

**Hook fires but always passes through**

Working correctly. Dispatch only blocks when a marketplace alternative scores 10+ points higher. If the tools Claude is reaching for are already well-matched to your task, you won't see intercepts.

**I'm getting too many intercepts**

Say `skip dispatch` to suppress for the rest of the session. Or increase the gap threshold by editing `THRESHOLD` in `~/.claude/hooks/dispatch-preuse.sh` (default: 10).

**Slow intercepts (2–4 seconds)**

On Free/BYOK, Dispatch hits the live marketplace on each intercept. This is expected. Pro users get <200ms responses from the pre-ranked catalog.

**"Degraded mode" during install**

The `anthropic` Python package couldn't be imported. Usually a system Python/PEP 668 issue. Fix:
```bash
pip3 install anthropic --break-system-packages
# or use a virtual environment
```

**Lost your token**

Go to `https://tooldispatch.visionairy.biz/token-lookup` — signs you in with GitHub and shows your token.

**Want to uninstall**

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

Removes all files, hook scripts, and settings.json entries automatically.

## Privacy

**BYOK mode:** all Haiku calls go directly from your machine to Anthropic. Nothing passes through Dispatch servers.

**Hosted mode:** your last ~3 messages and working directory path are sent to `tooldispatch.visionairy.biz` for classification and immediately discarded. We store your GitHub username, task type labels (e.g. `flutter-fixing`), and tool scores. We do not store conversation content.

Full privacy table in [README](../README.md#privacy). To delete your account, email dispatch@visionairy.biz.

## Getting more from Dispatch

Add the official plugin marketplaces for broader search coverage:

```
/plugins add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
/plugins add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
```

Browse skills relevant to your stack:

```bash
npx skills find flutter
npx skills find supabase
npx skills find nextjs
```

The more relevant tools are installed and registered, the more often Dispatch has useful alternatives to surface.
