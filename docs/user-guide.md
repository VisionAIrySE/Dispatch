# ToolDispatch User Guide

**ToolDispatch** — your Claude Code insurance policy. Two modules that cover both sides of the problem.

**Dispatch** surfaces the best plugin, skill, or MCP when you shift tasks, and blocks tool calls when a better marketplace alternative exists. **XF Audit** catches broken module contracts before they run — syntax errors, missing imports, arity mismatches, broken function signatures — across Python, TypeScript, Dart, and Bash — and provides a concrete repair plan with a three-state consent flow.

You don't know what you don't know. Neither does Claude Code. And the ecosystem is exploding — new tools ship every week, the gap between what you're using and what's out there grows every day. And Claude Code produces architecturally sound code that often doesn't connect. ToolDispatch covers both problems, leaves a record, and gets out of the way.

---

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ToolDispatch/Dispatch.git
cd Dispatch
bash install.sh
```

`install.sh` takes ~2 minutes. It:
- Checks Python 3.8+ and Node.js are available
- Registers two hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Asks how you want to connect — Hosted (recommended, free token) or BYOK (bring your own Anthropic key, for restricted environments)

### 2. Get a free token (Hosted mode)

When `install.sh` asks for a token, visit:

```
https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/auth/github
```

Sign in with GitHub. Copy the token shown on screen and paste it into the install prompt.

**Already installed and need your token?** Visit `https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/token-lookup` — it re-runs OAuth and shows your token again.

### 3. Start a new CC session

**Critical:** hooks load at session startup. The install won't affect your current session. Open a new terminal and run `claude` (or restart your IDE's CC session).

### 4. Verify it's running

In the new session, type:

```
/dispatch status
```

You'll see your mode, plan, token (masked), and whether both hooks are installed. If a hook shows MISSING, re-run `bash install.sh`.

---

## What happens during a session

Here's what's actually running:

**Every message you send** — Hook 1 runs (~100ms). It reads your last few messages and checks if you've shifted to a different type of task. If you haven't shifted, it exits silently. If you have, it maps the shift to a category and immediately surfaces grouped tool recommendations (Stage 3) into Claude's context — grouped by Plugins, Skills, and MCPs. You see each category's recommendations once per session.

**Every tool call Claude makes** — Hook 2 runs before Claude uses a Skill, Agent, or MCP tool. It checks the marketplace for tools relevant to your current task. If it finds one that scores 10+ points higher than what Claude was about to use, it blocks and shows you the comparison.

---

## When Dispatch recommends proactively

When Dispatch detects a task shift, it immediately surfaces a grouped recommendation list into Claude's context — before Claude reaches for any tool. You'll see something like this:

```
[Dispatch] Recommended tools for this flutter-building task:

Plugins:
  • flutter-mobile-app-dev — Expert Flutter agent for widgets, state, iOS/Android.
    Install: claude install plugin:anthropic:flutter-mobile-app-dev

Skills:
  • VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev — Flutter dev skill for widget building.
    Install: claude install VisionAIrySE/flutter@flutter-dev

MCPs:
  • fluttermcp — Dart analysis and widget tree inspection server.
    Install: claude mcp add fluttermcp npx -y @fluttermcp/server

Not sure which to pick? Ask me — I can explain the differences.
```

### What to do with it

**Ask Claude about any of them** — say "what's the difference between the plugin and the MCP?" Claude will explain based on what Dispatch surfaced.

**Install one** — paste the install command shown, or run it manually. For tools that require a restart, use `/compact` first to preserve your session context.

**Ignore it and keep working** — the list appears once and won't repeat for the same topic this session. There's no prompt waiting for a response.


---

## When Dispatch intercepts

Hook 2 fires before every Skill, Agent, or MCP tool call. When Claude's chosen tool scores 10+ points lower than a marketplace alternative, Dispatch blocks and shows you the comparison — grouped by type, with three scoring components per tool:

```
[Dispatch] Better tools exist for this flutter-fixing task.
'superpowers:systematic-debugging' (skill) scores 62 for this task.

── Plugins ──
  • flutter-mobile-app-dev
     Relevance 91 · Signal 78 · Velocity 62  installs:12,400 stars:340 forks:28

     ⚠ no description — install at your own risk

Note: Review before installing. Dispatch surfaces tools based on community signals
and task context — not a security audit.

⚠ Marketplace tools score higher than 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' (skill) for this task.
  Options:
  1. Say 'proceed' to continue with 'superpowers:systematic-debugging' (one-time bypass, no restart needed)
  2. Install flutter-mobile-app-dev plugin — run /compact first, then install and restart CC
  3. Ignore Dispatch for this task — say 'skip dispatch'
```

### Your three options

**1. Say `proceed`**
Claude uses its original tool choice. The bypass lasts for this one tool call. If Claude reaches for the same tool again, Dispatch will check again (unless you say `skip dispatch`).

**2. Install the recommended tool**
```bash
/compact          # saves your session context
npx skills add flutter-mobile-app-dev -y
claude            # restart — picks up where you left off
```
The tool is now available to Claude for future sessions.

**3. Say `skip dispatch`**
Dispatch ignores this task type for the rest of the current session. Use this when you've already got the right tools for the job and don't need suggestions.

## Check your status

```
/dispatch status
```

Shows:
- **Mode** — hosted, byok, or unconfigured
- **Plan** — free or pro
- **Token** — masked display
- **Hook 1 / Hook 2** — installed or MISSING
- **Last task** — most recent task type Dispatch classified
- **Category** — which of the 16 MECE categories it mapped to
- **Working dir** — where the last shift was detected
- **Bypass** — whether a bypass token is currently active

**Founding Dispatcher:** First 300 paying users lock in $6/month for life. Once the founding tier fills, new signups pay standard $10/month.

*BYOK runs entirely on your machine against your own API key — no data goes through ToolDispatch servers. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to use any OpenRouter model (free models available, including Llama and Nemotron). Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for direct Claude access. Override the default model in `~/.claude/dispatch/config.json`. Free and Pro tiers run inference through ToolDispatch's servers — you provide nothing and pay nothing for the LLM calls.

## XF Audit — what happens on every edit

XF Audit fires before every file Edit and Write. On a clean pass, you'll see this appear in your chat:

```
◈ XFBA  47 modules · 203 edges  ✓ 0 violations
◈ XSIA  ✓ 0 concerns
```

**XFBA** (XF Boundary Auditor) checks the proposed file content against your live codebase graph before the write lands — broken imports, arity mismatches, missing env vars, consumed stubs.

**XSIA** (XF System Impact Analyzer) flags edits with systemic reach — callers that will be affected, data flow changes, side effects, error handling gaps.

**Supported languages:** Python, TypeScript, TSX, Dart, and Bash. If you're working in React Native or Flutter, your full stack is covered — not just Python glue code.

### When XF Audit blocks

If XFBA finds a real violation, Claude sees this instead of the clean stamp:

```
◈ XFBA  This edit will break at runtime.

  evaluator.py:203 — calls rank_tools() with 3 arguments, but it only accepts 2.
  This will throw a TypeError when that code runs.

  [Fix problem]   Type "Fix problem" — I'll apply the repair, re-audit, and promise clean
  [Show diff]     Type "Show diff"  — show me the exact change before deciding
```

**Your three options:**

- **Say `Fix problem`** — Claude applies the repair, re-audits, and outputs `<promise>XFBA_CLEAN</promise>` when the codebase is clean
- **Say `Show diff`** — Claude shows exactly what changes before applying anything; you then say `Apply fix` or `I'll handle it`
- **Say `I'll handle it`** — allows the edit through and logs the violation to `.xf/repair_log.json` for later review

### Refactor Mode

When you're mid-refactor and the code is intentionally broken across files, XFBA would normally block every intermediate edit. Refactor Mode holds all violations without blocking and presents them as a consolidated list when you're done.

**Starting a refactor:**

Tell Claude:
```
start refactor mode — renaming do_work to process_task across all callers
```

Claude will write the refactor flag file and confirm tracking is active. All subsequent edits pass through without blocking; violations accumulate in memory.

**Ending a refactor:**

Tell Claude:
```
end refactor mode
```

Claude presents every violation that fired during the session as a single consolidated repair list. You work through them in one pass.

**When to use it:**

- Renaming a function used in 10+ files
- Changing a function signature and updating all callers
- Splitting a module into two (callers temporarily broken)
- Any edit sequence where intermediate states are intentionally invalid

**When not to use it:**

- Normal development — XFBA's per-edit blocking is the point
- When you're not sure what you're changing — violations tell you the blast radius

**Note:** Refactor Mode is never activated automatically. XF Audit previously suggested it when it detected a repeated symbol — that behavior has been removed. You activate it explicitly when you know you need it.

### The record

Every scan writes `.xf/boundary_violations.json`. Every repair is logged to `.xf/repair_log.json` with timestamp and accepted/declined status. When something goes wrong in production, the log tells you whether XF Audit caught it.

### Handling false positives

XF Audit catches real bugs, but occasionally flags valid code as a violation — e.g., a function using `**kwargs` that the arity checker misreads, or a pattern the scanner doesn't recognize.

**One-time: say "skip for now"**
Claude will pass the edit through for this call only. Nothing is persisted.

**XSIA only: "let it ride"**
For XSIA systemic concerns (not XFBA blocking violations), run:
```bash
touch ~/.claude/xf-boundary-auditor/.xf/xsia_bypass
```
Then retry the edit. The bypass expires in 120 seconds.

**Persistent: suppress via `.xf/suppress.json`**
Create or edit `.xf/suppress.json` in your project root. Two formats:

```json
// Suppress an entire violation type:
{"suppress": [{"type": "silent_exception", "reason": "intentional broad catch in hooks"}]}

// Suppress a specific function only (arity or interface violations):
{"suppress": [{"type": "arity_mismatch", "symbol": "_viol", "reason": "uses **kwargs"}]}
```

Suppressed violations are filtered before the block decision — they don't appear in output or block edits. The `reason` field is optional but recommended for future reference.

**When XFBA itself has a bug**
If the false positive is caused by a checker bug (e.g., `**kwargs` not recognized, submodule imports misidentified), fix the checker. The CLAUDE.md architectural principle applies: Bash edits to installed files at `~/.claude/xf-boundary-auditor/` are acceptable when the Edit tool creates a circular XFBA dependency.

## XFTC — Token Control (Module 3)

XFTC runs three hooks alongside Dispatch and XF Audit. It controls token usage through a persistent status line, behavioral nudges, and enforcement blocks.

### What you'll see in your terminal

**Status line** (all tiers — always on after install):
```
claude-sonnet-4-6 | ████░░░░░░ 42% | 420k of 1000k tokens
```

**Nudges and blocks** look like this (Pro):
```
◎ XFTC  2 MCP servers active (~36k tokens/message overhead)
         Disconnect unused servers with /mcp to reduce baseline cost
```

**Ghost notification** (Free/BYOK — once per session, when a trigger is detected):
```
◎ XFTC  Your CLAUDE.md is 287 lines — every line burns context on every message
         Run /dispatch-compact-md to compact it — or upgrade for full token hog detection: dispatch.visionairy.biz/pro
```

### What XFTC watches for

| Check | When it fires | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md length | Session start, if project or global CLAUDE.md >200 lines | All tiers |
| Skills size | Session start, if >15 skills or >200KB total installed | All tiers |
| Memory audit | Session start, if MEMORY.md has broken links | Pro |
| MCP overhead | Session start, if >2 servers active | Pro |
| Sub-agent model | Every Agent call using Opus or Sonnet on lightweight task | Pro |
| Verbose commands | Every Bash call matching verbose patterns | Pro |
| 60% compact reminder | When context is estimated ~60% full | Pro |
| Peak hour nudge | Session start on weekday 8am–2pm ET | Pro |
| Cache timeout reminder | Session start after >5 min break with prior context | Pro (Mon only) |
| Version notification | New release available | All tiers (Mon only) |

### Tier access

| | Free | BYOK | Pro |
|---|---|---|---|
| Status line | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ghost notification | ✓ (once/session) | ✓ (once/session) | — |
| All nudges | — | — | ✓ |
| Enforcement blocks | — | — | ✓ |

### When XFTC blocks

When XFTC blocks a tool call (sub-agent Opus, verbose command), you have two options:

1. **Say `proceed`** — Claude retries the tool call and XFTC passes it through for that one call
2. **Change the approach** — switch to Haiku, or use the suggested alternative command

### Troubleshooting XFTC

**Status line not showing**
Open a new terminal after install. If still missing, run `install.sh` again — it re-configures the status line without touching other settings.

**XFTC is silent on Free/BYOK**
Not entirely — CLAUDE.md length check fires for all tiers every session. You'll also see one ghost notification per session when XFTC detects an MCP overhead, peak hours, or context usage trigger. Full nudges and enforcement blocks require Pro.

**XFTC is blocking too aggressively**
The verbose command list and lightweight keyword list are configurable. Edit `~/.claude/xftc/checks/command_check.py` (VERBOSE_PATTERNS) and `~/.claude/xftc/checks/model_check.py` (LIGHTWEIGHT_KEYWORDS) to tune.

**Upgrade to Pro to unlock full XFTC**
`https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/pro?token=YOUR_TOKEN`

### Skills installed with Dispatch

Four slash commands are installed automatically:

**`/dispatch-status`** — show hook state, last task detected, category, quota, and bypass token status.

**`/dispatch-compact-md`** — compact oversized CLAUDE.md files. When XFTC flags your CLAUDE.md as too large, run this command. Claude will:
1. Find all CLAUDE.md files over 200 lines
2. Identify reference-only sections (code examples, tables, changelogs)
3. Show you a compact plan with before/after line counts
4. Wait for confirmation, then move those sections to `~/.claude/ref/` files
5. Replace each moved section with a one-line pointer

```
CLAUDE.md compact plan: /home/user/MyProject/CLAUDE.md
Current: 287 lines → Target: ~90 lines

Sections to move to ~/.claude/ref/:
  → ref/playwright-testing.md  — E2E Testing Patterns (~80 lines)
  → ref/edit-verification.md   — Edit Verification Steps (~60 lines)

Sections staying in CLAUDE.md:
  ✓ Honesty Protocol
  ✓ Mandatory Protocols (rule summaries only)
  ✓ Tools table

Proceed?
```

**`/warm-start`** — capture a complete session snapshot so the next session starts with zero re-explanation. Run this at the end of any session where significant work was done, or when XFTC nudges about broken MEMORY.md links. Claude will:
1. Run `git log` + `git status` to establish actual build state
2. Run all test suites and record counts
3. Audit MEMORY.md for broken links — back up to `MEMORY.md.bak` and fix before continuing
4. Write a dated session snapshot file to your project memory directory
5. Update the `START HERE` section of MEMORY.md
6. Commit any CLAUDE.md changes

```
Warm start complete.

Snapshot: project_2026-04-03-session2.md
Tests: 409 passing
MEMORY.md: 2 broken links fixed (backup: MEMORY.md.bak)
Next: implement TS/Dart scanners
```

The snapshot is automatically discovered by the next session's context loader.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing is happening / Dispatch is silent**

This is usually correct — Dispatch only intercepts when the gap is 10+ points. To check it's actually running:
1. Type `/dispatch status` — verify both hooks show "installed"
2. Make sure you're in a **new** CC session started after install
3. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` — look for `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` hook entries

**Proactive recommendations aren't appearing**

Proactive recommendations fire only on a confirmed task shift (confidence ≥ 0.7) and only once per category per session. If you haven't switched topics, no output is expected. Make sure you started a **new** CC session after install.

**"UserPromptSubmit hook error" in the sidebar**

Harmless cosmetic message. Dispatch exits cleanly on any error — it never blocks Claude. This can appear when running CC in a directory that isn't a development project (e.g. the Dispatch directory itself). Doesn't affect functionality.

**Hook fires but always passes through**

Working correctly. Dispatch only blocks when a marketplace alternative scores 10+ points higher. If the tools Claude is reaching for are already well-matched to your task, you won't see intercepts.

**I'm getting too many intercepts**

Say `skip dispatch` to suppress for the rest of the session. Or increase the gap threshold by editing `THRESHOLD` in `~/.claude/hooks/dispatch-preuse.sh` (default: 10).

**Slow intercepts (2–4 seconds)**

On Free/BYOK, Dispatch hits the live marketplace on each intercept. This is expected. Pro users get <200ms responses from the pre-ranked catalog.

**"Degraded mode" during install**

The `anthropic` Python package couldn't be imported. Usually a system Python/PEP 668 issue. Fix:
```bash
pip3 install anthropic --break-system-packages
# or use a virtual environment
```

**Lost your token**

Go to `https://dispatch.visionairy.biz/token-lookup` — signs you in with GitHub and shows your token.

**Want to uninstall**

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```

Removes all files, hook scripts, and settings.json entries automatically.

---

## Privacy

**BYOK mode:** all Haiku calls go directly from your machine to Anthropic. Nothing passes through Dispatch servers.

**Hosted mode:** your last ~3 messages and working directory path are sent to `dispatch.visionairy.biz` for classification and immediately discarded. We store your GitHub username, task type labels (e.g. `flutter-fixing`), and tool scores. We do not store conversation content.

Full privacy table in [README](../README.md#privacy). To delete your account, email dispatch@visionairy.biz.

## Getting more from Dispatch

Add the official plugin marketplaces for broader search coverage:

```
/plugins add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
/plugins add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
```

Browse skills relevant to your stack:

```bash
npx skills find flutter
npx skills find supabase
npx skills find nextjs
```

The more relevant tools are installed and registered, the more often Dispatch has useful alternatives to surface.
